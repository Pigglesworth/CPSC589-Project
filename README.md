# CPSC589-Project

This application allows the user to draw lines defining volumes which are used to create trees.
These trees can be exported as .obj files.

Usage
==============
Each two lines drawn will define its own volume. Multiples volumes can be drawn.
When you are done with this process, you place the starting point of the tree.
When the tree has grown to an acceptable state, you can then generate a mesh.

Controls
--------------

w - zoom camera in
s - zoom camera out
a - rotate camara clockwise
d - rotate camera counter-clockwise
q - pan camera up
e - pan camera down

Enter - Finish drawing lines, allow placement of starting point
Escape - Generate mesh from tree
